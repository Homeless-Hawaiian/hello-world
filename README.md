Tutorial
I am an aspiring electrical engineer coming out of New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, New Mexico Tech for short. I have lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico all my life; during the school year I live down in Socorro, New Mexico. I’m always looking for ways to expand my professional resume. I’ve been a low voltage cable technicion, IT support and data handler. I have always wanted to learn about anything I could get my hands on and I'm always interested in expanding my skills
